# BreastCancerDetection-ArtificialNeuralNetwork
This repository contains a neural network implementation designed to detect breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The neural network model is trained on a dataset specifically curated for breast cancer detection, which includes a variety of features and corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer.
